# Install NGINX with self signed SSL certificate integration at Ubuntu 18.04
##steps below :
1. Update repo and install Nginx 
2. create openssl self sign private key and self signed certificate 
3. Create a Configuration Snippet Pointing to the SSL Key and Certificate
4. Configure Nginx sites-availabale/config file for SSL integration & website directory
5. Soft link between sites-available/config file   with sites-enable/ directory
6. Verify NGINX connection
7. Finally browse website and check whether it works or not 

## Implementation:
1. Update repo and install Nginx<br/> 
```
sudo apt-get update && apt-get install nginx -y
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx start
[ ok ] Starting nginx (via systemctl): nginx.service.
sudo /etc/init.d/nginx status
```
2. create openssl self sign private key and self signed certificate
```
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt
```
output and parameters input

```
Generating a RSA private key
........................................................+++++
..+++++
writing new private key to '/etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key'
-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
-----
Country Name (2 letter code) [AU]:BD
State or Province Name (full name) [Some-State]:DHK
Locality Name (eg, city) []:DHK
Organization Name (eg, company) [Internet Widgits Pty Ltd]:Self
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:self
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:asifops.io
Email Address []:
```

both of the private key and certificate files created under /etc/ssl directory 
```
ls -lrt /etc/ssl/
total 32
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 10998 May 27 19:15 openssl.cnf
drwx------ 2 root root  4096 Nov  3 07:21 private
drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 16384 Nov  3 07:22 certs
```

3. Create a Configuration Snippet Pointing to the SSL Key and Certificate
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf
ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/certs/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/private/nginx-selfsigned.key;
save and exit 
```

4. Configure Nginx config file for SSL integration & website directory

N.B:   /etc/nginx/sites-available directory should contain all the static files for ur website
/etc/nginx/sites-enable directory will link with /etc/nginx/sites-available. 
/etc/nginx/sites-enable directory file will read by NGINX to load the configuration

First, backup of current config file 
```
sudo cp /etc/nginx/sites-available/default /etc/nginx/sites-available/default.bak
```
second, config the default config file
```
sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
```
comment out below lines

	#listen 80 default_server;
	#listen [::]:80 default_server;

Uncomment below lines and add line “include snippets/self-signed.conf;”  here /etc/nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf  is configuration snipset pointing to ssl private key and certificates . steps is following :

	listen 443 ssl default_server;
	 listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
 	include snippets/self-signed.conf;
